## Course Info
How can robots perceive the world and their own movements so that they accomplish navigation and manipulation tasks?  
In this module, we will study how images and videos acquired by cameras mounted on robots are transformed into representations like 
features and optical flow.  Such 2D representations allow us then to extract 3D information about where the camera is and in which 
direction the robot moves.  You will come to understand how grasping objects is facilitated by the computation of 3D posing of objects 
and navigation can be accomplished by visual odometry and landmark-based localization.
